# CS340_FinalProject
This is the portfolio project for CS 340: Introduction to Databases. 
A travel database website including interactive UI, built as a collaborative project.

The goal of this project was to develop a front-end website that worked with a backend database. 
This project was developed collaboratively with another student in my class over the course of ~9 weeks.

This project was completed and submitted on 3/14/2020. 
The original repository for the project is at this link: https://github.com/septembrr/new-wave-travel-db
